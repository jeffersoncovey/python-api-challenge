Welcome to my README. 

Part 1: Open WeatherPy directory and run WeatherPy.ipynb. This process takes a random assortment of Lat,Lon to create a list of cities that we can run analysis on. The excel is an output of this data. The PNG's are graphs for further analysis. *Running it again will create a brand new data set*

Part 2: Open VacationPy directory. This process takes the csv found in the previous example and attempts to identify a hotel in the best vacation destinations based on average weather.

Thank you for taking a look at this. I hope you are able to enjoy one of these fabulous vacation spots.
